Dot Panic does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.

However, the app integrates Google AdMob to display advertisements. As a result:

  •	This data is used solely for the purpose of providing personalized and relevant advertisements.
	
  •	**Dot Panic itself does not access or store this data.**


We do not use any analytics services and the app does not require account creation or login.
