# What is Dot Panic 2.0?

**It's a mobile game that works only on iOS.**

Yes, I developed it myself — and I was constantly getting enraged while coding this damn thing, because I know absolutely nothing about Xcode.
So, I hope you guys rage quit while playing it too ;) [Download Dot Panic 2.0](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/dot-panic-2-0/id6747173152?l=tr)

Have fun folks!
